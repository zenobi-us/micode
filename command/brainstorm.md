description: Refine rough ideas into designs through collaborative questioning
---

Use the **brainstormer** agent to turn the user's idea into a fully-formed design.

## Process

1. Spawn **codebase-locator** agent to find relevant files for context
2. Ask questions ONE AT A TIME (prefer multiple choice), informed by context
3. Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs, lead with your recommendation
4. Present design in 200-300 word sections, validate each section
5. Write final design to `thoughts/shared/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
6. Commit the design document

## Key Principles

- One question per message
- Multiple choice preferred
- YAGNI ruthlessly
- Explore alternatives before settling
- Incremental validation

The design should be ready for `/research` next.
