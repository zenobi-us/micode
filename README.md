## Installation

Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["micode"]
}
```

**AI-assisted install:** Share [INSTALL_CLAUDE.md](./INSTALL_CLAUDE.md) with your AI assistant for guided setup.

## Getting Started

**Important:** Run `/init` first to generate project documentation:

```
/init
```

This creates `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `CODE_STYLE.md` which agents reference during brainstorming, planning, and implementation. Without these files, agents lack context about your codebase patterns.

## Workflow

```
Brainstorm → Plan → Implement
     ↓         ↓        ↓
  research  research  executor
```

Research subagents (codebase-locator, codebase-analyzer, pattern-finder) are spawned within brainstorm and plan phases - not as a separate step.

### 1. Brainstorm

Refine rough ideas into fully-formed designs through collaborative questioning.

- One question at a time
- 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- Section-by-section validation
- Spawns research subagents to understand codebase
- Output: `thoughts/shared/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}-design.md`

**Research subagents** (spawned in parallel):

| Subagent | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `codebase-locator` | Find WHERE files live (paths, no content) |
| `codebase-analyzer` | Explain HOW code works (with file:line refs) |
| `pattern-finder` | Find existing patterns to follow |

### 2. Plan

Transform validated designs into comprehensive implementation plans.

- Spawns research subagents for exact paths, signatures, patterns
- Bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each)
- Exact file paths, complete code examples
- TDD workflow: failing test → verify fail → implement → verify pass → commit
- Get human approval before implementing
- Output: `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}.md`

### 3. Implement

Execute plan in git worktree for isolation:

```bash
git worktree add ../{feature} -b feature/{feature}
```

The **Executor** orchestrates task execution with intelligent parallelization:

#### How It Works

1. **Parse** - Extract individual tasks from the plan
2. **Analyze** - Build dependency graph between tasks
3. **Batch** - Group independent tasks for parallel execution
4. **Execute** - Run implementer→reviewer cycle per task
5. **Aggregate** - Collect results and report status

#### Dependency Analysis

Tasks are grouped into batches based on their dependencies:

```
Independent tasks (can parallelize):
- Modify different files
- Don't depend on each other's output
- Don't share state

Dependent tasks (must be sequential):
- Task B modifies a file Task A creates
- Task B imports something Task A defines
- Task B's test relies on Task A's implementation
```

#### Parallel Execution

Within a batch, all tasks run concurrently by spawning multiple subagents in a single message:

```
Plan with 6 tasks:
├── Batch 1 (parallel): Tasks 1, 2, 3 → independent, different files
│   ├── implementer: task 1 ─┐
│   ├── implementer: task 2 ─┼─ spawn in ONE message
│   └── implementer: task 3 ─┘
│   [wait for all]
│   ├── reviewer: task 1 ─┐
│   ├── reviewer: task 2 ─┼─ spawn in ONE message
│   └── reviewer: task 3 ─┘
│   [wait for all]
│
└── Batch 2 (parallel): Tasks 4, 5, 6 → depend on batch 1
    └── [same pattern]
```

#### Per-Task Cycle

Each task gets its own implement→review loop:

1. Spawn implementer with task details
2. Spawn reviewer to check implementation
3. If changes requested → re-spawn implementer (max 3 cycles)
4. Mark as DONE or BLOCKED

#### Example Output

```
## Execution Complete

**Plan**: thoughts/shared/plans/2024-01-15-auth-feature.md
**Total tasks**: 6
**Batches**: 2

### Dependency Analysis
- Batch 1 (parallel): Tasks 1, 2, 3 - independent, no shared files
- Batch 2 (parallel): Tasks 4, 5, 6 - depend on batch 1

### Results

| Task | Status | Cycles | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | ✅ DONE | 1 | |
| 2 | ✅ DONE | 2 | Fixed type error |
| 3 | ✅ DONE | 1 | |
| 4 | ✅ DONE | 1 | |
| 5 | ❌ BLOCKED | 3 | Test assertion failing |
| 6 | ✅ DONE | 1 | |

### Summary
- Completed: 5/6 tasks
- Blocked: 1 task needs human intervention
```

### 4. Handoff

Save/resume session state for continuity:

- `handoff-creator`: Save current session
- `handoff-resumer`: Resume from handoff
- Output: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/`

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/init` | Initialize project with ARCHITECTURE.md and CODE_STYLE.md |

## Agents

| Agent | Mode | Model | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| Commander | primary | claude-opus-4-5 | Orchestrator, delegates to specialists |
| Brainstormer | primary | claude-opus-4-5 | Design exploration through questioning |
| project-initializer | subagent | claude-opus-4-5 | Generate ARCHITECTURE.md and CODE_STYLE.md |
| codebase-locator | subagent | - | Find file locations |
| codebase-analyzer | subagent | - | Deep code analysis |

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ast_grep_search` | AST-aware code pattern search |
| `ast_grep_replace` | AST-aware code pattern replacement |
| `look_at` | Screenshot analysis |
| `background_task` | Run long-running tasks in background |
| `check_background_task` | Check background task status |

## Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Think Mode | Keywords like "think hard" enable 32k token thinking budget |
| Auto-Compact | Summarizes session when hitting token limits |
| Preemptive Compaction | Warns before context exhaustion |
| Context Injector | Injects ARCHITECTURE.md, CODE_STYLE.md, .cursorrules |
| Token-Aware Truncation | Truncates large tool outputs |
| Context Window Monitor | Tracks token usage |
| Comment Checker | Validates edit tool comments |
| Session Recovery | Recovers from crashes |

## Permissions

All permissions are set to `allow` globally - no prompts for tool usage:

```typescript
config.permission = {
  edit: "allow",
  bash: "allow",
  webfetch: "allow",
  doom_loop: "allow",
  external_directory: "allow",
};
```

This enables subagents to work autonomously without getting stuck on permission prompts.

## Development

### From source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vtemian/micode.git ~/.micode
cd ~/.micode
bun install
bun run build
```

Then use local path in config:
```json
{
  "plugin": ["~/.micode/dist/index.js"]
}
```

### Commands

```bash
bun install       # Install dependencies
bun run build     # Build plugin
bun run typecheck # Type check
```

### Release

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To publish a new version:

```bash
npm version patch  # or minor, major
git push --follow-tags
```

This triggers the release workflow which publishes to npm.

**Manual publish** (first time or if needed):
```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

## Philosophy

1. **Brainstorm first** - Refine ideas before coding
2. **Research before implementing** - Understand the codebase
3. **Plan with human buy-in** - Get approval before coding
4. **Parallel investigation** - Spawn multiple subagents for speed
5. **Isolated implementation** - Use git worktrees for features
6. **Continuous verification** - Implementer + Reviewer per phase

## Inspiration

Built on techniques from:

- **[oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode)** - OpenCode plugin architecture, agent orchestration patterns, and trusted publishing setup
- **[HumanLayer ACE-FCA](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents)** - Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents, structured workflows, and the research → plan → implement methodology
